This is the README file.

The csv_files folder consists of the csv files of our mock data.

The FinalGroup.sql file consists of our DDL code.

csv_to_sql.ipynb is a python Jyupter Notebook that loads in all of the csv files into the the DDL. Make sure the DDL file is run before this Jyupter Notebook is run.

gui.py is our frontend, written in Python Tkinter.
